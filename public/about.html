<h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>Hey There, I'm Kady</p>
  <p>Kady The Alchemist</p>

  <p>I'm quite new to the world of tech but I must say, I am loving it here!</p>
  <p>Naturally I am a very creative person so this really does expand and broaden my horizon.</p>

  <p>I'm a qualifed Jewellery Designer and Manufactuer and I plan to bring out my own jewellery brand in the new future (sooner than you think!) </p>
  <p>I wanted to challenge myself into learning how to create my own website and server to better understand the creative process, being a active part in that and I also get to learn a fun skill at the same time!</p>
